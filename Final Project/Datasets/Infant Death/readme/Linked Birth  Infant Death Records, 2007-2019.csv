not be available.,,,,,,,,,,,
---,,,,,,,,,,,
Caveats:,,,,,,,,,,,
1. 'Unreliable' appears for rates when there are fewer than 20 deaths in the numerator. This is because the figure does not meet,,,,,,,,,,,
the NCHS standard of reliability or precision. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/lbd.html#Unreliable.,,,,,,,,,,,
2. Infant deaths are weighted so numbers may not exactly add to totals due to rounding. More information:,,,,,,,,,,,
http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/lbd.html#WeightFactors-Totals.,,,,,,,,,,,
3. Note that there may be slight differences in the number of infant deaths when comparing the Linked Birth / Death Records to,,,,,,,,,,,
the other vital statistics. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/lbd.html#Weight Factors.,,,,,,,,,,,
4. Circumstances in Georgia for the years 2008 and 2009 have resulted in unusually high death counts for the ICD-10 cause of,,,,,,,,,,,
"death code R99, ""Other ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality."" Caution should be used in interpreting these data.",,,,,,,,,,,
